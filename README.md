==========

Drop-A-Spell is an experimental chrome extension that allows a user to modify content on websites they visit using voice commands called "spells".

Currently Supported Spells:
---------------------------

The following spells are currently supported:

- **Hide** : this spell tells the browser to hide the body of the current website
- **Show** : this spell tells the browser to show the body of the current website (reverses the **Hide** spell).


Well, because Speech Recognition features (and generall the Web Speech APIs) are still very experimental and unreliable,
so that that's all the magic we can promise to give you :-) Not because more spells wouldn't be possible, but even the 
performance on these 2 spells isn't awesome just yet... so we are busy in the conclave, cooking new alchemy for you.


I don't do magick, can I help?
------------------------------

Well, you probably do some, you just don't know it yet. Anyways, if you'd like to hack this extension or contribute more spells, 
refine stuff, etc, just clone the repo and try the extension home, and make a pull-request. Otherwise, share with your folks...


Beware!
-------

If you don't trust this extension, well, just don't install it! It's magic after all...
But you could easily look under-the-hood, the only thing you should worry about is the "system" getting access to your speech... but you also keep asking for freedom of speech, right? Now, put that to good use here...
